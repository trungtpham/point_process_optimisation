function M = area_intersect_circle_analytical(varargin)
% Compute the overlap area between 2 circles defined in an array.
% Computation is vectorized, and intersection area are computed an
% analytical way.
%   
% Input: Circles data presented in an array G of three columns.
%        G contains parameters of the n circles
%           . G(1:n,1) - x-coordinate of the center of circles,
%           . G(1:n,2) - y-coordinate of the center of circles,
%           . G(1:n,3) - radii of the circles 
%        Each row of the array contains the information for one circle.
% 
%        Input can also be provided in three different vectors. These
%        vectors can be row or column vectors. The 1st one corresponds to
%        x-coordinate of the center of circles, the 2nd one to the
%        y-cooridnate and the 3rd one to the radii of the circles.
% 
% 
% Output: Square matrix M(n,n) containing intersection areas between
% circles
%         M(i,j) contains the intersection area between circles i & j
%         By definition, M(i,i) corresponds to the area of circle i.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% For 2 circles i & j, three cases are possible depending on the distance
% d(i,j) of the centers of the circles i and j.
%   Case 1: Circles i & j do not overlap, there is no overlap area M(i,j)=0;
%             Condition: d(i,j)>= ri+rj
%             M(i,j) = 0;
%   Case 2: Circles i & j fully overlap, the overlap area has to be computed.
%             Condition: d(i,j)<= abs(ri-rj)
%            M(i,j) = pi*min(ri,rj).^2
%   Case 3: Circles i & j partially overlap, the overlap area has to be computed
%            decomposing the overlap area.
%             Condition: (d(i,j)> abs(ri-rj)) & (d(i,j)<(ri+rj))
%            M(i,j) = f(xi,yi,ri,xj,yj,rj)
%                   = ri^2*arctan2(yk,xk)+ ...
%                     rj^2*arctan2(yk,d(i,j)-xk)-d(i,j)*yk
%             where xk = (ri^2-rj^2+d(i,j)^2)/(2*d(i,j))
